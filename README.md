# kai_schedule

A mobile app for students of KNRTU-KAI to make their daily routine simpler

## Reason

The app might be considered as `kai.ru` wrapper. Official mobile-unfriendly ugly inconvenient website had to be replaced by something usable. Here the Kai_schedule comes in.

## Stack

The application is designed based on the BLoC architecture. Therefore, the main packages are bloc and flutter_bloc, as well as hydrated_bloc to save the last state in the cache.
